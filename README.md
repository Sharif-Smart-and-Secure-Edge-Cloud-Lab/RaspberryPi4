# RASPBERRY PI 4
## Mahdi Siami
###### This is a tutorial of how to start with raspberry pi 4.

## The first step is Setting up the firmware
At first with need a SD card to install raspberry pi OS(Raspian) on it.
we go to the [Raspberry Pi Website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) and download Raspberry Pi Imager, for installing Raspian.

**Rememeber we should Format our SD card before installing anything on it.**

Raspberry Pi Imager also has a section for formating the SD card.

in Raspberry Pi Imager we choose default OS and our SD card as storage.

if we want to work with Raspberry Pi without monitor and keyboard and from our laptop before 

writing the OS we set the SSH and WiFi setting in Raspberry Pi Imager special setting.

once writing is finished we put our SD card at back of our board and, it connects to our network wich we set at previous section.

we use instructions of connecting with SSH from the [link](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-headless-setup-how-to,6028.html)
our system is ready to use.


*first step of our work is finished (Set up the firmware)*

## The second step is driving WiFi and BLE

Because we use SSH to connect and we started raspberry pi headless we already used WiFi and this part is done.
for blutooth part we just make our system visible using VNC and pair our raspberry to devices we want easily.
we could do this using terminal and we can find the instructions online easily but this way is a way more easy.

*second step of our work is finished (Drive WiFi and BLE)*

## The third step is Set up UART and CAN
This part was postponed due to lack of equipment but you can find instructions for starting online and we will do it later ...

## The fourth step is Setting up the Camera

for setting up the camera first we need a raspberry pi camera

we connect the camera to the raspberry pi, we should connect it to the right place onn the board and be careful to not harm the camera.
Now we should enable camera in raspberry.
we use these instructions to do this.

Run `sudo raspi-config` in terminal.
Navigate to Interface Options and select Legacy camera to enable it.
Reboot your Raspberry Pi.

###### chalenge 1 : our VNC doesn't work when camera is enabled.
to solve this problem we use this intructions:
uncomment `hdmi_force_hotplug=1` in `/boot/config.txt`.
then, reboot.

for editting `config.txt` we use this command
`sudo nano /boot/config.txt`

now we can use our VNC again.
###### for taking pictures we can use this command 

`raspistill -o filename.jpg `

for saving our image on out pc we can use this command be carefull you should use this on your pc's terminal.

`scp pi@(raspberrypi IP):~/filename.jpg ./` 

then you should enter raspberry pi password and save it.

as we handled our problem from privious part we can use python codes for taking pictures and videos in our raspberry desktop.
we use intructions and codes from these sites.

[for taking pictures](https://howchoo.com/pi/how-to-take-a-picture-with-your-raspberry-pi#:~:text=3-,Enable%20the%20camera,enable%20it%20using%20raspi%2Dconfig.&text=Once%20raspi%2Dconfig%20opens%2C%20use,%22%20and%20then%20%22Finish%22.)

*fourth step of our work is finished (Set up the Camera)*

## The fifth step is Setting up python and c++ with the cross compiler

*fifth step of our work is finished (Set up python and c++ with the cross compiler)*

## The sixth step is Implementing a face detection app 

There is a link for this step which leads of doing these steps for preparing the face detection app.
1. Install Dependencies for Raspberry Pi Facial Recognition : 1:  install OpenCV   2: install Imutils

for installing openCV we use intructions of [this](https://singleboardbytes.com/647/install-opencv-raspberry-pi-4.htm) site.
2. we continue with the instruction of [this](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-facial-recognition) site.
3. we connect our raspberry pi camera and run python codes, we take pictures and save it in our database then we use the face detector python code and detect faces which w saved in our database.

*sixth step of our work is finished (Implement a face detection app)*

## The seventh step is Setting up the Edge Impulse framework
we use instructions of [this](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/development-platforms/officially-supported-cpu-gpu-targets/raspberry-pi-4)

There is a part for installing docker on our system for installing docker we use
