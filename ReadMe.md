# RaspberryPi 4
In this repository, we will provide some guidelines for setting up RaspberryPi4.
## Set Up the firmware
To start using RaspberryPi4 you need a SD card to burn RaspberryPi OS. For burning OS, you can use RaspberryPi4 Imager; it can be downloaded from [This Link](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
RaspberryPi Imager look like picture below:

![RP Imager](https://github.com/Sharif-Smart-and-Secure-Edge-Cloud-Lab/RaspberryPi4/blob/M.Amin.H.Khodaverdian/RP%20Imager.JPG)

You can choose your arbitrary OS and select your SD card, then click on Write to burn OS to your SD card. After putting your SD Card in RaspberryPi, it will use this OS.

### SSH
For connecting to your RaspberryPi, one of the most common ways is using SSH(Secure Shell Protocol). But by default, SSH is disabled in RaspberryPi.In the new version of RaspberryPi Imager, you can enable SSH.

There is another way to make a file with the **ssh** name and copy the file into the SD card. It will enable ssh automatically in your RaspberryPi

## Drive Wi-Fi
To connect your RaspberryPi to an arbitrary Wi-Fi, there is two way that we will describe it.
### First Way
In the latest version of RaspberryPi imager, you can choose a Wi-Fi that will be the default Wi-Fi for RaspberryPi. You can see the settings in the image below:

![WIFI](https://github.com/Sharif-Smart-and-Secure-Edge-Cloud-Lab/RaspberryPi4/blob/M.Amin.H.Khodaverdian/Wi-Fi.JPG)

### Second Way
Put the Raspberry Pi OS SD card into your computer. Navigate to the boot directory. Then add your **wpa_supplicant.conf** file. The **wpa_supplicant.conf** file should contain this commands:
```
country=IR # Your 2-digit country code
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
network={
    ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
    psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Put your SD card in the Raspberry Pi, boot, and connect.

## Drive BLE
For start using Bluetooth you need to do following steps.(I confront several problems after using default BLE so I search and the results([best result link](https://www.instructables.com/Control-Bluetooth-LE-Devices-From-A-Raspberry-Pi/)) are written below)

By default, the Raspbian distribution comes without a Bluetooth stack. The bluez package is quite old and has patchy support for Low Energy. You can build and install a more modern version as described below.

After the system is up and running open up the Terminal program and a browser window, then start following the commands.

**Do Not do this:** 
```
sudo apt-get install bluez
```

In case you have it already installed, go ahead and remove it. If you're not sure if you have it installed, go ahead and do this step anyway:
```
sudo apt-get --purge remove bluez
```
Next, we have to determine what's the latest version available. To do this, navigate to [the official website](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/) and look for the package bluez-X.XX.tar.xz where X.XX is the version

Then, go back to the Terminal on the Raspberry Pi and remembering to change X.XX for the latest version we find we enter:
```
cd ~; wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-X.XX.tar.xz
```

Subsequently, we uncompress the package by:
```
tar xvf bluez-X.XX.tar.xz
```

We need at this point to make sure all the necessary libraries for running the bluetooth stack:

```
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev
```

Are now ready to compile the bluez package:

```
cd bluez-X.XX

export LDFLAGS=-lrt

./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --enable-library -disable-systemd

make

sudo make install
```

For a strange reason the standard installation process misses installing one of the files to the correct directory. To solve this:

```
sudo cp attrib/gatttool /usr/bin/
```
### Using BLE
You can use a monitor or VNCViewer to use BLE or commands. This section will give a guide to using BLE with commands.

#### Checking Bluetooth Status
Before you can add Bluetooth devices, the Bluetooth service on your computer must be up and running. You can check it with the help of the **systemctl** command.

```
sudo systemctl status bluetooth
```

If the Bluetooth service status is not active you will have to enable it first. Then start the service so it launches automatically whenever you boot your computer.

```
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

#### Scanning for Nearby Devices
To actively search for Bluetooth devices that you can connect to, use the **scan** command as follows:

```
bluetoothctl scan on
```

To make your Bluetooth adapter discoverable to other devices, use the following command:

```
bluetoothctl discoverable on
```

#### Connecting to Your Device
Now that you have a list of Bluetooth devices you can connect to, use the MAC address to connect to a particular device.
The simplest way to connect with a Bluetooth device is to pair it with your RaspberryPi using the pair command.

```
bluetoothctl pair $MAC_address
```

If the device you are connecting to has a GUI interface, for example, a smartphone, the device will display a prompt asking you to accept the connection. The system will also ask you to confirm the pairing on your PC. You can do so by typing yes in the command line.

For devices that are already paired with your PC, you can simply connect to them in the future using the connect command as follows:

```
bluetoothctl connect $MAC_address
```

#### Listing Paired Devices With bluetoothctl
You can look at the devices that are currently paired with your system by running the following command:

```
bluetoothctl paired-devices
```

## Set up the Camera
First of all, we should connect Camera to RaspberryPi carefully as image below:
